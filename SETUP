SETUP file for YaPooL

1 Setting Up the Project

To be able to modify the gwt part of yapool, you just need to create a new project in eclipse(new project > select the simplest type: project)
with the path of the folder yapoolGWT


2 Set Up the server

to be able to run the project in dev mode, you have to run it with an external server, apache or lighttpd for instance.
then copy all the ressources that are under the "war" directory of the project inti the folder that you will access via you server.

then you need to set up two proxied url:

localhost /_session  	>  	localhost:5984/_session
localhost /_yapooldb/ 	>	localhost:5984/yapooldb/

an mod_proxy configuration for lighttpd can be found as a HowTo in the root of the YaPooL repository folder
